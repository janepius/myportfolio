          <p>  I'm Pius MaryAnn from Amiri Oru east L.G.A Imo State Nigeria . I was born in April 25 , 2005 in Oba Idemili south L.G.A Anambra state into a family of seven as the third child to Mr. and Mrs. Pius Cyracus. I had my primary and secondary school education at Devans Creative  and Comprehensive Secondary school , Oba Idemili south L.G.A Anambra State .</p>
           <p> My interest intech began after my WAEC examination although I wasn't really a fan of tech as a kid but I figured that at some point in ones's life interest and purpose change . As far back as I recall , during the late quater of my secondary education , my choice of career was in healthcare professional specially a gynecologist or so I thought . After my graduate from secondary school as time passed . I began to realize my interest in a healthcare wasnt't as strong as I thought it was when I saw how well grounded my close friend back then was with computers . I had no knowledge on computers neither did I know my way around one .I  became curious about these devices and how my friend could get so good with computer operation something seemingly difficult . I got more inquisitive then I started getting obsessed and throught the months I became willing to learn just so at least to be like my friend HaHaHa . I began making researches on computers , how to operate them .</p>  
           <p> The obsession tremendously suppressed my interest to become a healthcare professional  I almost forgot I had something like that in mind , My aim drifted to getting into medicine to studying computer science in school , maybe that way I can be close to computers . As I further researched into computers ,i only realized that computers in general is not a field on it's own , they are just machine used to do so many things in different fields . I further discovered that my interest did not stop in just handling computers , I wanted to do something more with them . I stumbled upon the tech space , I can remember it feeling like home . Out of the various fields in tech , I knew I wanted to become a web developer naturally . The idea of how website are created and how it works intrigued me . My parents  were suppotive of my choice although they were a little skeptical about it which was understandable because I was making a major life changing decision and they had to be sure I knew what I was doing . They got me my first laptop and I registered with a tech faculty , Nnewi tech faculty at Nnewi , Idemili south L.G.A Anambra state where my world of tech was unlocked and my quest to be a web developer "BEGAN" . </p> 
           <p> At first it wasn't easy and I was slowly loosing interest but I held unto that word "PERSEVERANCE" . After some time I startd knowing my way around my laptop and became familiar with the terms in tech under my tutor Mr. Andre whom was known as Dre . Afer some time due to personal reasons he discontinued tutoring us and we got under Mr. Favour Okpala who was always ready to impact in us what was needed and necessary as a web developer . Then through hard work and consistent effort from my part , my interest in web development peaked and the passion for it ignited . I became willing to choose this part as my life career and dedicated myself to the industry . My will to learn more and as far as possible in this field became stronger and it has been a good experience so far. I am a junior developer and I will keep developing myself in web development . </p>
